# Vita's app - CS50 Final Project

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/iUF180hIDa0

### Description:

- final project for CS50 course  


My Project is a simple application that allows user to write down notes and other information and allows them to share it with one selected person.

Every user have to register, after registration user
can login in to application. Login and registraion form are
using WTForms for validation. The page checks if all input
field are filled, if e-mail has valid format and if two
passwords are the same.  
After logging in user can see four sections: Home, Notice Board, Connect and About.
Most important is NOtice Board - it allows user to
write Notices - for example it can be TO DO list, things
to buy etc. User can edit, delete or add new Notices in this section.  
Another important part is Connect which is made for
connectiong with another user. If user want to connect
with another user, he needs to know his e-mail.  
In Connect section you can also see recieved and sent
requests to connect and also here you can accept the request.
After connecting with another user in Notice board section you will
have new button which enables sharing Notices of your
choice. If you don't want to be connected with another
user, you can delete your connection in Connect section.
